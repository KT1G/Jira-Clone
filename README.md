# End-to-End Fullstack Jira Clone

Welcome to the **End-to-End Fullstack Jira Clone** repository! This project is a fully-featured, real-world Jira clone that provides powerful project management functionality. It’s designed for teams and individuals who need to manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate efficiently within a workspace.

## Features

This clone goes beyond a simple task management tool and implements an extensive feature set to replicate Jira’s functionality, including:

- **Workspaces**: Organize your projects within separate workspaces for different teams or departments.
- **Projects & Epics**: Structure your work at a high level with projects and break them down into epics.
- **Tasks & Subtasks**: Create tasks within projects and manage sub-tasks for granular control.
- **Kanban Boards**: Visualize your workflow with dynamic kanban boards for each project.
- **Calendars**: View tasks and deadlines in a calendar view for effective time management.
- **Task Editing & Deletion**: Modify or remove tasks and epics with ease to keep your projects up-to-date.
- **Invite System**: Invite team members to join workspaces, allowing collaborative effort.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Control access to different parts of the application based on user roles (admin, member, viewer, etc.).
- **Image Uploads**: Attach images to tasks for better documentation and visual reference.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Track the progress of your projects with detailed analytics and reporting tools.
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system, with session management and optional third-party authentication support.
